## Installation

**1. Installing Java**

download the java language in your machine from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

**2. Downloading IDE** 

You can use any IDE(integrated development environment) for your comfort like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) the  but in our syllabus they teach us in [SciTE Editor](https://www.scintilla.org/SciTEDownload.html)(extremely old xD) so I recommend using SciTE I know it's old and UI is trash but if you practice in it you can easily program in trash computers of school in board exams ;0
